Rhythm minigame format scripts for the Yakuza series

These are probably pretty outdated and broken, [KUMA](https://github.com/Timo654/kuma) is a better alternative (it does have fully working writers for all Old Engine rhythm game formats except FOTNS, even though they don't get used by the tool).
